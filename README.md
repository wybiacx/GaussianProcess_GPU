# Gaussian Process Regression with GPU

This is a project that uses NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate Gaussian Process Regression computations.

The project includes both a CPU-based implementation and a GPU-accelerated implementation of Gaussian Processes (GP). The GPU version leverages NVIDIA's cuSolver library for enhanced performance.

Please note that both the GPU and CPU versions of the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in this project are experimental and were developed as part of the author's exploration to deepen their understanding of CUDA. Use in production environments is not recommended without careful consideration.
